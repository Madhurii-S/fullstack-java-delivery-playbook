# Full Stack Java Application Delivery Playbook

This repository outlines the end-to-end delivery approach for full stack Java applications,
from requirement analysis to production support.

It reflects hands-on experience working across backend services, frontend integration,
testing, CI/CD pipelines, and cloud-based deployments.

---

## Requirement & Design Phase

- Requirement grooming with business stakeholders
- Translating requirements into technical designs
- Defining API contracts and data models
- Identifying integration dependencies

- Validating fixes through targeted test cases

---

## CI/CD & Deployment

- Source control using Git and branching strategies
- Automated builds using Maven
- CI/CD pipelines using Jenkins or GitLab CI
- Containerization using Docker
- Environment-specific configuration handling

---

## Production Support

- Monitoring application behavior post-deployment
- Analyzing logs to troubleshoot issues
- Fixing defects and performing root cause analysis
- Supporting releases and hotfixes
